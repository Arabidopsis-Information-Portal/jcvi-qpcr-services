Web services for "Expression Profiling of the Arabidopsis Transcriptome / Reporter Images"
==========================================================================================

Objective: Creating web services from JCVI's qPCR and promoter-reported work, which was a 2010 project. This will serve as a demo of how to perpetuate these (2010 project data in general) results which are useful to a few people but almost invisible.
